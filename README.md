# CIA Lab 3 - DNS
For this lab and DNSSEC that will follow, half of you will use BIND. If you have an even student number, you should use BIND, otherwise Unbound+NSD. You will use your students PC for installing DNS servers. We have an sne21.ru domain and the subdomain with name stX.sne21ru (X - is your student number) that will be delegated for your nameserver.
